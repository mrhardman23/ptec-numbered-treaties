      <p>
        <span>Treaty 5</span>, or the Winnipeg Treaty, was signed in 1875-76 by the federal government, Ojibwa peoples and the Swampy Cree of
        Lake Winnipeg. This treaty included First Nations tribes located in the northern regions of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario,
        including Saulteaux, the number of bands that inhabited the Beren's River region, and the Norway House region. Treaty 5 covers much of
        present-day central and northern Manitoba. The aboriginal people that were included in treaty 5 wanted nothing more than what had
        already been offered to other first nations group under the original treaties. The people in and around Lake Winnipeg had not been
        included under previous agreements. They wanted recognition of their claim to the area as well as certain hunting and fishing rights.
        Other groups around those included in treaty 5 had also received “treaty money” and this was also a demand made by some groups. There
        were also two demands from specific bands that made the signing of this treaty somewhat unique. The band at Beren's River had asked for
        construction tools in addition to the monetary payment. The people of the Norway House (located about 30 km north of Lake Winnipeg)
        were also suffering from starvation, as the lands there were not suitable for farming. This community was looking to relocate from
        north of the lake to an area in the south that had more suitable agricultural lands. Their relocation proposal was met with government
        approval, and it was agreed that the Crown would include the people of the Norway House in treaty negotiations.

      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        <span>In the mid-1870s</span>, the Indigenous peoples of the Lake Winnipeg area were interested in making a treaty with the Government
        of Canada. They had heard about the concessions offered to the Indigenous nations of Treaties 1 to 4, and subsequently demanded the
        government provide similar economic assistance, provisions of tools and protection against the encroachment of outsiders (such as
        surveyors and settlers) on their territories. While the government was interested in opening up the Lake Winnipeg region for future
        development, they were not initially keen on negotiating a new treaty. Treaties 1 to 4 had already secured title to the agricultural
        belt in the West. The government eventually agreed to enter treaty talks with the Berens River bands and other communities around the
        lake. However, they were not yet willing to negotiate a treaty with Indigenous bands north of the lake, even though they too had
        expressed a desire to enter into a treaty with the Crown. The land in the north had limited agricultural and settlement potential, and
        was therefore not a priority for the government. However, one exception was made for the Norway House band, as stated above, and the
        Treaty was created.
