      <p>
        <span>The Numbered Treaties</span> were a series of 11 treaties made between the Crown and First Nations from 1871 to 1921. They cover
        the area between the Lake of the Woods (northern Ontario, southern Manitoba) to the Rocky Mountains (northeastern British Columbia and
        interior Plains of Alberta) to the Beaufort Sea (north of Yukon and the Northwest Territories). The treaties provided the Crown with
        land for industrial development and white settlement. In exchange for their traditional territory, government negotiators made various
        promises to First Nations, both orally and in the written texts of the treaties. These include special rights to treaty lands and the
        distribution of cash payments, hunting and fishing tools, farming supplies, and the like. These terms of agreement are controversial
        and contested. To this day, the Numbered Treaties have ongoing legal and socio-economic impacts on Indigenous communities. The creation
        of reserves, schools and other instruments of assimilation have affected Indigenous cultures, customs and traditional ways of life. In
        addition, ongoing disputes about the oral and written terms of the treaties pertaining to land use, fishing and hunting rights, natural
        resource use, and the like, have led to modern land claims. In order to address concerns about treaty fulfilment, the federal
        government established a policy recognizing comprehensive and specific claims in 1973. In spite of inadequacies in the treaty-making
        process, the Numbered Treaties have helped to guide the relationship between the federal government and First Nation peoples by
        providing a context of mutual responsibilities and rights. As modern land claims are resolved and concluded, the Canadian government
        and treaty First Nations work together towards improving the lives of Indigenous peoples.
