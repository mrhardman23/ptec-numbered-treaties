        <h2 class="header">What Were The Terms:</h2>
        <p>
          The terms of Treaty 2 were very similar to those of Treaty 1,
          involving mostly the exchange of land for various promises and
          payments. It was written in the Treaty 2 terms that the Anishinaabe
          people would agree to surrender a large chunk of their land to the
          Crown. The land exchanged in Treaty 2 was directly West and North of
          Manitoba at the time and three times bigger than the province. In
          exchange for the land, each band would receive a reserve large enough
          to provide 160 acres of land for each family of five, as well as
          schools located on the reserves and a gratuity.

      <section>
        <h2 class="header">What Were the Outside Promises:</h2>
        <p>
          The Outside promises of Treaty 2 were verbal promises made during the
          negotiations that were not included in the actual treaty. These
          promises include provisions for food, agricultural equipment, and the
          right to continue using the surrendered lands for hunting and fishing.
          Multiple bands started to complain about the unfulfilled promises of
          the treaty shortly after its signing. It took the federal government
          until April 30, 1875, to finally resolve the issues surrounding the
          Outside Promises by appending them to the treaty.
