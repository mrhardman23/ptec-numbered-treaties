        <p>
          Treaty 2 is being implemented today by the First Nations in
          Treaty 2 Territory organization, also known as the FNT2T. They formed on June 12,
          2018, at an assembly at Lake Manitoba First Nation by the Anishinaabe
          Agowidiiwinan Governing Council. They decided Anishinaabe and
          Agowdidiiiwinian would promote the formation of a collective nation
          consisting of all the First Nations with land reserves in Treaty 2.
          They would also include the Dakotas, Cree and Nakota peoples.

        <p>
          The FNT2T is working towards developing housing and infrastructure for
          their people, enhancing their government structure and Ancestral law
          development. However, they face multiple challenges like funding
          discrimination and the Canadian Treasury's housing and infrastructure
          funds being under the control of colonial governments. The FNT2T is
          currently assisting Local Nations with the restoration of housing and
          infrastructure.

        <h2 class="header">What Makes This Treaty Unique</h2>
        <p>
          Treaty 2's ceded land was 92,426.6 square kilometers, more than double
          the land area of Treaty 1. Despite the larger land area, the signing
          gifts and promises remained mostly the same as Treaty 1. They were
          given the same amount of land for each family of five as Treaty One,
          the same signing gift of three dollars, and the same annuity for each
          family of five. In the written Crown obligations, it is
          stated that the Crown gave “Indians,” the exclusive use of lands set
          aside for them, which is not written in any of the other treaties.
