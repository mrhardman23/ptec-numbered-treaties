        <h2 class="header">What is a Treaty:</h2>

        <p>
          A treaty is a <span>formal agreement between nations.</span> The
          treaty establishes the responsibilities of each nation in their
          relationship with the other and is legally binding. In the case of 
          Numbered Treaties 1 to 11 in Canada, they were between the Canadian government
          and the Indigenous peoples. The Numbered Treaties of Canada provided
          the framework for how Indigenous peoples and the Canadian government would
          live together and share the land.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a huge difference between how the Indigenous peoples saw the
          Treaties and how the government did. For the Indigenous peoples, treaty meant
          to bring things together and create sacred promises. They saw the treaty as a
          way to build relationships and share the land. This contrasts with the
          Canadian government who used words like surrendered or gave up. To
          the Canadian government, the treaties were a way to make the Indigenous peoples 
          give up their land.

        <h2 class="header">Treaty 2:</h2>
        <p>
          Treaty 2 was signed shortly after Treaty 1. Signed in August 1871 at
          the Manitboa House Fur Trading Post, the land of Treaty 2 extends
          North and West of Treaty 1 territory and was three times the size of
          Manitoba at the time. The treaty contains 21,440,909 acres of land or
          roughly 86,768 square kilometers.

          <span>
            The Canadian Government aimed to take the Indigenous peoples' land
            and assimilate them and their culture into European society.
          </span>
          Indigenous people were concerned for their lands and traditional ways
          and wanted to secure their future by forming a good relationship with
          the Canadian government.
