/*
  Various shades of green were chosen for this website because green represents nature, which is highly valued
  by indigenous peoples, and because it represents growth, a thing which we are constantly looking towards.
  Green's positives lend themselves to the theme of this site, which is why they are used both as the main 
  and secondary colours, but also as the tinted neutrals.

  Only other colour seen is yellow, which is used for a sun. Happiness and joy.

  You never want your text to be completely black as it hurts the eyes so alas here we have set our main text colour throughout
  body to be a dark green. The background colour is default completely white which will also burn the eyeballs of the average human,
  so here we set it once again to a green, but this time a tile able repeating background of light green.
  The font is also changed to an Arial font of default with the exception of if Arial is not installed on the clients computer. In which 
  case it will attempt to load the webpage in the Helvetica font. If all else fails whatever sans-serif font the client has on hand will
  be loaded. Font size too is changed, to 1.8rem, and as discussed previously, on an average monitor will be equal to 18px.
