      <h3>Councils</h3>
      <p>
        "Councils are a very important part of the governance structure of Grand Council Treaty #3. They bring the history of the past and the
        knowledge of the future. They are also the connection to ensure balance and equality for Gitiziminan (Elders), Oshkiniigig (Youth),
        Mizi'iwe Aana Kwat (2SLGBTQQIA+), Gaagiidoo-Ikwewag (Women) and Mamawichi-Gabowitaa-Ininiwag (Men) in the Treaty #3 Anishinaabe
        Nation." <a href="http://gct3.ca/our-nation/" class="quote-link">-Grand Council Treaty 3</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Each council consists of members of Treaty 3 who have been chosen through a natural selection process, which consists of representations
        for each of the four directions. They were chosen for their expertise, skill, and traditional knowledge. Their role is to bring forth
        the history, unique needs, and voices of Elders, Women, Men, and Youth.
