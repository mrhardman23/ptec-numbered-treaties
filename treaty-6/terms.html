        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          "Prior to the near extinction of the American bison or buffalo in the
          late nineteenth century as waves of non-Indigenous immigrants arrived
          on the American frontier, traditional bison hunting was the way of
          life of the Plains Indians peoples, whose traditional lands spanned
          the North American great bison belt. Bison were the cultural symbol of
          these tribes â€” providing food, clothing and shelter. By 1871, the
          Indigenous peoples from the northern plains of the North-West
          Territories (NWT), the Cree, Ojibwa and Assiniboine, considered
          negotiating a treaty with the government to protect their traditional
          lands from settlers and HBC surveyors. By the 1870s, the population of
          the once-plentiful bison had decreased to the point that tribal
          chiefs, elders, and many of the people sought the Crown's protection
          to ward off starvation. They believed that a treaty with the
          government would guarantee assistance and prevent starvation.
          <br />
          <br />
          The fear of smallpox, which had spread to the northern plains tribes
          during the smallpox pandemic of 1870-1874, was another motivation for
          the chiefs to consider entering into a treaty with the Crown. The
          epidemic spread to the northern plains tribes, killing many of the
          Cree who had no immunity to this new disease. Because of emigration,
          smallpox had been introduced to America over the centuries. By 1873,
          thousands had caught the disease, hundreds, in eastern cities, such as
          Boston and New York and it had spread into Canada. Previous smallpox
          epidemics brought by the emigrants to America included the 1837 Great
          Plains smallpox epidemic that killed thousands of Indigenous people
          along the Missouri River."

        <h2>Medicine Chest</h2>
        <p>
          "One of the selling points of the treaty was that a medicine chest
          would be kept at the home of the Indian agent for use by the people.
          The "medicine chest clause" has been interpreted by native leaders to
          mean that the federal government has an obligation to provide all
          forms of healthcare to First Nations people on an ongoing basis. In
          particular, the Assembly of First Nations considers the funding of the
          Non-Insured Health Benefits program as one aspect of this
          responsibility."

        <h2>Miscommunication</h2>
        <p>
          "The Government of Canada believes the terms of the Treaty were
          written down clearly within the document, but in the oral traditions
          of the Indigenous peoples, they have a different understanding of the
          Treaty terms. Although there were three interpreters present at the
          negotiations for Treaty 6, two from the Crown and one from the
          Indigenous peoples, direct translation of words between English and
          Cree was not possible. Certain words in either language did not have a
          corresponding word in the opposite language. This meant that both
          groups did not understand each other fully as the concepts were
          changed due to the word changes between the languages. The Indigenous
          peoples had to especially rely on their interpreter because the
          document they were to sign was solely in English, giving them the
          disadvantage as the interpreter had to explain the words, meanings and
          concepts of the Treaty text because the Cree could not speak or read
          English. The Indigenous peoples claim they accepted Treaty 6 because
          they were informed that the Crown did not want to buy their land, but
          instead borrow it. Another understanding was that the Indigenous
          peoples could choose the amount of land they wanted to retain, but
          surveyors came to set per person perimeters on the reserves which was
          seen as a violation of the Treaty. Indigenous peoples thought the
          Treaty would adapt due to the changing conditions such as the amount
          of currency, the drastic change in health services, and the more
          efficient agricultural tools which have been invented or modified to
          better suit the conditions of farming. However, the Treaty terms have
          remained the same which have caused Indigenous peoples to believe the
          Treaty terms should be re-evaluated to better suit the needs of
          Indigenous people today."
